--Readme--

Hello! Thank you for downloading Aiba! She is one of the main characters (along with Kaname Date) of AI: The Somnium Files (AI:TSF). She is an artificial intelligence downloaded into a fake eyeball that resides in Date's left eye socket. In this Ukagaka, she takes her hamster form. If you are unfamiliar with AI:TSF, I recommend reading the Key Terms and Personnel options located in the Files section of Aiba's menu. More personnel files will be unlocked as Aiba and Date mention them in their conversations. 

Aiba has a spoiler toggle in her config menu that defaults to "none". "Minor" will mention things later in the game's plot, but will not spoil any major plot points. "Major" spoils everything in the game.

In terms of timeline, no spoiler toggle and minor spoiler toggle take place vaguely after Mizuki end. Major spoiler toggle takes place after Resolution end. 

If you encounter a bug (even something as small as a spelling mistake), please contact me either through email (yuyugamedev@gmail.com), or any of the social sites listed under Dev Socials in Aiba's right click menu.

------------------------Credits

Zichqec - https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/ - Wrote the X. Template that Aiba was built off of, along with other invaluable contributions like introducing me to Ping Pong Loops for Aiba's shell so that I could get Date's talking animation working cleanly

Wormspawn - https://khittyhawk.github.io/ukagaka/ - Often the voice of reason in my dev thread. Has tipped me off to numerous yaya/sakurascript functions I didn't even know existed. Would absolutely still be banging my head against a wall trying to figure out how to keep track of time in code if not for their insights

Ayaka - https://www.twitter.com/aya_seashell - Has let me pester them for Japanese questions of which I am very grateful for. Brightened my mood in my dev thread (perhaps unknowningly) many times when I was frustrated.
